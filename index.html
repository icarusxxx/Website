            <h3>D1E1 - Introductions / Show & Tell</h3>
            <p> The first thing I want to show is the research I did during my first PoU, I spent most of my time trying to define the problem and coming up with the best way to prest my resaerch and solutions.
                You can start scrolling from page 14. My outputs were a zine, 3D rendered model and a project proposal. It was a great experience, doing the research and applying everything I had learnt.
                I feel like I learnt a lot about Bangalore as well, normally we don't pay attention to problems and brush thinsg off but once you get into it you realise all the complications and necessities being ignored.

                <br> <br> <br>
                <p> The second project I would like to show would be my work from the second PoU. I made a low fieldelity website and app on figma.
                    I tried to come up with an innovative solution to promote the Nature centre and incorporated my research into the outputs.
                    I found the case study very intersting and learnt a lot during the process.
                    I had also just learnt Figma during that time so I was eager to delve into this project.

            <h3>D1E2 - Examples of Human-Machine Interactions</h3>
            <p>This was a fun exersize. Coming up with examples and listening to other people's presentation made me see things in a different light.
                I feel like my observation about the little things has increased in terms of relating to how the smallest of interactions can make a big difference.
